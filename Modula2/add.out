Word-Counter
------------

Notes:

The original Word Count program, when tested on the table (test.wc)
failed to consider hyphened words as single words. i.e sun-day would
be taken as two words instead of one.
There were two problems encountered while considering hyphens :-
1. Hyphens can be used to underline words
                          ---------
2. Hyphens only join a single word together - this hyphen cannot 
be considered to be a word. but this one-can.

Hence, in the modified program, a global variable prevch was added 
which was a boolean variable. This would be set and reset depending 
on whether there were two hyphens or one. Hence, this would be 
considered as one word :
                             one-word

But this would be considered as two words:

			     two -- words

This approach also solved the problem of underlined words
since more than one hyphen following the other would cause the word
to be ignored.

Blank lines, commas etc. were handled perfectly by the program, as
were the number of characters in the file.

Hence, no further modifications were required.
