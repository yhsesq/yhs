Program to add two times together...

Enter the hours of the first time :0

Enter the minutes of the first time :0

Enter the seconds of the first time :0

Enter the hours of the second time :0

Enter the minutes of the second time :0

Enter the seconds of the second time :0



 The First Time is -  0 :  0 :  0
 The Second Time is -  0 :  0 :  0


The added time is =   0 :  0 :  0

This demonstrates the fact that the program can add together 
2 null times.

Program to add two times together...

Enter the hours of the first time :1

Enter the minutes of the first time :38

Enter the seconds of the first time :42

Enter the hours of the second time :3

Enter the minutes of the second time :43

Enter the seconds of the second time :33



 The First Time is -  1 : 38 : 42
 The Second Time is -  3 : 43 : 33


The added time is =   5 : 22 : 15

This shows that the program works even with two carries
in the minutes and the seconds.

scriptss$ Time


Program to add two times together...

Enter the hours of the first time :13

Enter the minutes of the first time :12

Enter the seconds of the first time :12

Enter the hours of the second time :17

Enter the minutes of the second time :48

Enter the seconds of the second time :53



 The First Time is - 13 : 12 : 12
 The Second Time is - 17 : 48 : 53


The added time is =  31 :  1 :  5

This validates the hours function. Since the program specification 
does not allow for days, the hours are simply added.

scriptss$ Time


Program to add two times together...

Enter the hours of the first time :10

Enter the minutes of the first time :45

Enter the seconds of the first time :22

Enter the hours of the second time :1

Enter the minutes of the second time :5

Enter the seconds of the second time :3



 The First Time is - 10 : 45 : 22
 The Second Time is -  1 :  5 :  3


The added time is =  11 : 50 : 25

This adds two times without carries.

Limitations:
1. No Error checking on the hrs/mins/secs.
2. Negative times will generate errors since the variables are CARDINAL.
3. No days since it was not in the program specifications.
4. No AM/PM. Only military format times allowed. AM/PM was also 
not part of the specification of the program.
