NAME

  Alarm - Sets an alarm in 12/24 hour times and launches alarmdaemon 

	in the background.


SYNOPSIS

  Alarm is a simple script consisting of two parts. The first one is 

  a simple script called Alarm which inputs and allows the second

  script called alarmdaemon to be launched in the background. The daemon

  sleeps until the time specified is reached and then triggers that alarm

  off in intervals of 5 , 3 , 1 and 0 minutes to the specified alarm time.


PARAMETERS

	Alarm [hh] [mm]         -> 24 hour time
                        or
        Alarm [hh] [mm] [pm/am] -> 12 hour time


  Simply typing Alarm without any paramenters will display the screen above.

  To launch alarm simply type in the hours and minutes (time of day) to trigger

  the alarm at that speicified time.

DESCRIPTION

  A simple utility to set one alarm and launch a daemon in the background.

  Uses multithreading and may conflict with screen output from other programs.

NOTES

  A sample demonstration file Alarm.demo shows the precise working of this 

  utility in real time in the background.

RETURN VALUES

  A value of 0 is returned if the alarm is set, 1 or greater indicate errors.

  Output is relatively verbose and errors are displayed on the screen. 

  However, in the event of this utility being called from another program,

  the errorlevels will be set.

ERRORS

  A time specified previous to this time generate errors. Similarly,

  a time greater that 12 00 specified with an am/pm prefix will generate

  an error. Hours over 24 or less that 0 generate errors. Minutes over 

  60 generate errors too. The alarm is accurate to within +/- 15 secs

  of the present time.
