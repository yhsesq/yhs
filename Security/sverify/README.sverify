Verification script for Sentinel.

This program uses the standard implementation
code from the RIPEMD-160 function. This code
is *not* written by me. You must have sentinel
installed for this to work.

For installation :
[1] Type make
[2] Type ./Sverify

This will return the RIPEMD-160 bit checksum of the
sentinel executable. Store it in a safe place.
