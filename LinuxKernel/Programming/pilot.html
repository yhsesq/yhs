SITE PROBLEMS AT TRIPOD.</FONT>
<PRE>ZDOC is my initiative to create a GNU based (essentially freeware)
Aportis DOC handler program for the PalmPilot.&nbsp;
THE SOFTWARE ON THIS SITE IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GPL.
GO TO WWW.LINUX.ORG.UK/GPL.html TO READ THE LICENSE.

The following are the proposed version numbers for ZDOC :-
&nbsp;0.0.x - Basic development versions. No functionality other than&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database detection and classification.
&nbsp;1.0.x - Basic reader capable of handling uncompressed DOC files.
&nbsp;2.0.x - As 1.0.x but capable of reading compressed DOC files.
&nbsp;3.0.x - As 2.0.x but capable of writing to uncompressed DOC files.
&nbsp;4.0.x - As 3.0.x but capable of writing to compressed DOC files.
&nbsp;5.0.x - As 4.0.x but capable of encrypting text written/read to/from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOC files.
&nbsp;6.0.x - As 5.0.x but capable of Serial port receive/transmit of DOC&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; files.

If you are going to create your own versions I suggest you keep your
version numbers the same as mine. If you have additional functionality&nbsp;
please add version numbers while keeping the basic numbers constant.
For example if i include XYZ functionality to Version 2.0.0 my version
number should be 2.1.0. I will be incrementing 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 when a
major bug is fixed and for nothing else. Bug fixes are appreciated!

If you fix it i'll increment the version number and acknowledge you.

This website is updated weekly. Check back for more info.

Notes :-

14/6/98 - Beginning work on ZDOC -- Finally! Reading all the masses of dox.

15/6/98 - Finally got the basic Hello World to compile and run properly.&nbsp;

16/6/98 - Managed to get Version 0.0.0a running.

17/6/98 - Ver 0.0.0 stable. released on website.

18/6/98 - Ver 1.0.2a running. Not released due to bugs in the scrolling function.

19/6/98 - Work beginning on Ver 2.x due to the fact the compression/decompression
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was easier than i thought. Ver 2.0.0a running. Not released due to&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; improvements reqd in memory handling.

20/6/98 - Argh. no access to public terminal.&nbsp;

21/6/98 - Did some work in memory improvement. No access to public terminal. *sigh*

22/6/98 - Couldnt compile Ver 2.0.0b. Public access to terminal denied. dammit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully should get something up by tomorrow. *double_sigh*

23/6/98 - Compiled in support for compression. Problems with fields to arrays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversions. Released 2.0.0a and found a major bug with memory handling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0.1a now released with bits of the bug removed.&nbsp;

26/6/98 - Solved the horrible memory bug with help from 3COMs tech support !!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like their developer support is equally good compared to their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customer support -- thanks guys!! ZDOC updated...</PRE>

<PRE>Below is the messages i recvd which solved the problem :-

> >the emulator...said that my application had written to low memory...
> >I found it to be the DmWrite() call...
> >Are we allowed to continue using DmWrite() to databases ?
>
> Absolutely; DmWrite is the only way to write to a block in the storage
> heap.&nbsp; There must be something else going wrong in your app.
>
> Have you verified that the handle returned to you is non-zero?&nbsp; And are
> you really passing a zero as the second parameter to DmNewRecord? (It
> isn't allowed to be null; it needs to point to a local variable.)
>
> I bet that your handle is invalid.&nbsp; Check it out in the debugger.

Anyway, theres still a small bug left which i'll clean out sooner or later.
Weekend coming up so i think i'll leave it til monday. You can download
Ver 2.0.1b in the meantime.</PRE>

<PRE>26/6/98 ok..ok. i had some time so i removed the bug. no more bugs left (i think).</PRE>
<TT>Mail me if you find any bugs left over. i'm releasing this for beta
testing.</TT>
<BR><TT>Check ZDOC_ERR.TXT for any errata (not the crashable bug variety..just
glitches)</TT>
<BR><TT>before mailing me. If you find a bug that affects the system in
any way please</TT>
<BR><TT>mail me ASAP.</TT>

<P><TT>29/6/98 Worked over the weekend for the ZDOC manual + did the compressed
and uncompressed</TT>
<BR><TT>saving. Released ver3.x alpha and ver 4.x alpha. Note the alpha
releases corrupt files and</TT>
<BR><TT>will do so for some time until i get the bug out. Beta testing
program should hopefully</TT>
<BR><TT>throw some bugs out which can be corrected in all the versions.
Development work is currently</TT>
<BR><TT>going on full steam ahead and will continue to do so until a critical
level is reached.</TT>
<BR><TT>Then i'll begin on the debugging/glitch tidying portions. Do not
use alpha releases on anything</TT>
<BR><TT>other than debug roms + emulator.</TT>

<P><TT>30/6/98 bugs..bugs and more bugs. mainly related to memory handlers.
good news is compression</TT>
<BR><TT>routines have been validated and work nicely. bad news is that
at least 3 MAJOR bugs have been</TT>
<BR><TT>found all leading to severe and permanent database corruption.
all are in the saving routines</TT>
<BR><TT>and no others (whew! relief) but all cause corruption in currently
opened databases. development</TT>
<BR><TT>work is now halted while i try to combat the spread of the bugs
and limit memory loss. ZDOC_Tech.txt</TT>
<BR><TT>is now included with the alpha files which details the bugs discovered
and removed in (mainly)</TT>
<BR><TT>non technical terms.</TT>

<P><TT>1/7/98 ok..i seem to have removed (most) of the bugs...the alpha
release is proving to be more</TT>
<BR><TT>stable than the beta right now (gulp!)..anyway, at the request
of plenty of testers ive removed</TT>
<BR><TT>the pause while it displays file information...i was using it for
debugging, but i guess no one</TT>
<BR><TT>else wanted to so i've removed it in both the beta and alpha releases.
i spent most of today</TT>
<BR><TT>trying to whack my personal java security system into shape, so
not much progress was made on</TT>
<BR><TT>ZDOC excepting the bug fixes. i also found that Aportisdoc (mobile
edition) crashed! with an</TT>
<BR><TT>invalid low memory write when i tested it under the gremlins (3.0
debug rom)...guess you cant</TT>
<BR><TT>trust commercial software for lack of bugs either. theres still
2 bugs that i know of in ZDOC</TT>
<BR><TT>but both of them are minor and only occur if you fiddle with it
excessively (or run a gremlin</TT>
<BR><TT>on it). get rid of em when time permits..tommorrow i go full steam
ahead on the creating new</TT>
<BR><TT>files routines and the deleting and renaming ones (time permitting).
back to development!</TT>

<P><TT>2/7/98 Slight amount of housekeeping on ZDOC to make the code slightly
(very slightly) tidier.</TT>
<BR><TT>Alphas now a helluva lot more stable than the beta and i cant seem
to decide to do anything about</TT>
<BR><TT>the beta *sigh*. ZDOC 4.0.5a now has an improved menu with the
ability to create compressed and</TT>
<BR><TT>uncompressed DOC databases, with a user specified name. I'll spend
another day fixing 4.x before</TT>
<BR><TT>moving on to 5.x with encryption/decryption (encrypted DOCs)..encryption
will prolly be weak</TT>
<BR><TT>at this stage. I'll try and put in 512-bit PGP-style encryption
using the SSLeay/Pilot port..if</TT>
<BR><TT>its GNUable. Also finally start work on the version i really really
want..ver 6.x with serial i/o.</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><TT>3/7/98 More debugging and fixing of Ver4.x..also fixed the create
new DOC file (compressed &amp;</TT>
<BR><TT>uncompressed), improved field memory handling, activated the Close
and reload database from the</TT>
<BR><TT>menu, fixed the famous OS 3.x form bug (Bad Form Handler) documented
on 3COMs pages, improved the</TT>
<BR><TT>create New record function. Fixed the CloseAllForms() bug too.
Still got some problems with gremlins</TT>
<BR><TT>and underlocked field handlers...which i'll probably keep for a
while since i'll start work on</TT>
<BR><TT>encryption &amp; serial i/o next. Maybe switch 5.x and 6.x around
since serial i/o is more fun(?)</TT>
<BR><TT>to work on. Any case, i'll leave all this til monday.</TT>

<P><TT>7/7/98 Fixed one more bug. Added Serial Rx/Tx (untested..waiting
for sufficient hardware</TT>
<BR><TT>availability). Added weak encryption/decryption. Incremented version
no. to 5.0.0a.</TT>

<P><TT>8/7/98 Ok..finally tested the serial i/o and fixed a few problems.
Finally installed it on my pilot.</TT>
<BR><TT>Serial I/O works ok except for the following :- Serial Output only
works if you have no flow control,</TT>
<BR><TT>and your file is terminated with a few carriage returns. Also allow
CR translation to CR/LF.</TT>
<BR><TT>Serial Input works with only one 4K chunk at a time. You need to
have an open doc file when recieving</TT>
<BR><TT>but not when transmitting. Bit of a pain, but i'll keep the version
number to 5.x which is not supposed</TT>
<BR><TT>to have serial i/o until i can get some hardware for testing it
properly. Encryption seems to work ok,</TT>
<BR><TT>but its weak (8 bits). i'll play with the encryption and see if
i can assign passwords or something.</TT>

<P><TT>9/7/98 Minor changes and bugfixes. Also updated the manual page
and improved the encryption. Its still</TT>
<BR><TT>weak but can now allow the user to assign a password (max 8 bytes)
and uses the usual 64-bit rotating</TT>
<BR><TT>XOR one time pad type algorithm. Note that it can be cracked..but
now it requires some effort (128^8 possible combinations). Very difficult
to crack on a palm, should be able to be cracked on a PC. Its still compatible</TT>
<BR><TT>with files generated with the old one (i.e. if you dont enter a
password into the password field, it will</TT>
<BR><TT>decrypt the old algorithm) Note that i could not post up this version
because of tripods FTP service being</TT>
<BR><TT>disabled for some hardware problem. i'll push it up in a day or
two after they fix the FTP service. I'm</TT>
<BR><TT>switching into bug fixing stage since there doesnt seem to be any
major development work to do.</TT> <TT>As a temporary</TT>
<BR><TT>backup (while tripod is down ONLY) download 5.0.0b from <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/7689/zdoc.zip">here</A>.</TT>

<P><TT>10/7/98 Pending further notification ZDOC is now to be downloaded
from geocities. I've lost patience with</TT>
<BR><TT>tripod. Please update your links :- <B><U>http://www.geocities.com/Area51/7689/zdoc.zip</U></B></TT>

<P><TT>11/7/98 This is it folks. The end of the line for ZDOC development
(at least by me). Now work on this software will</TT>
<BR><TT>proceed only to the bug fixing stage. ZDOC is destined to remain
in beta for a loong time now. It's reasonably</TT>
<BR><TT>stable enough for me, and it does everything i need...so thats
where it'll remain. Some development work is being</TT>
<BR><TT>carried out in france to extend it with searching capabilities
at this time, but this is where i'm stopping. Ver5.0.0b</TT>
<BR><TT>is IT. I'll continue posting bug fixes up sloowly..if you find
a bug, please fix it. I have very limited computer</TT>
<BR><TT>access here and the official ZDOC development areas are deleted
off the public machine i was developing on. ZDOC is</TT>
<BR><TT>now installed on my personal palmpro, where its working happily
at this stage..few problems encountered with the keyboard..</TT>
<BR><TT>remember to scroll to the top of the record and click the pen at
the top line just before saving after using the builtin kbd..</TT>
<BR><TT>other than that its fine. Anyway, i've got one more project which
needed development for some time and i'm starting</TT>
<BR><TT>work on that (ZSecure/Java). Any enhancements/improvements etc.
that anyone would like to put up...post em to me. I</TT>
<BR><TT>have enough resources to work with HTML, so i can change/update
these pages easily.</TT>

<BR><TT>Send mail to me at : zurk@geocities.com telling me which version</TT>
<BR><TT>(i prefer you do the versions entirely than just a few addons)
you want</TT>

would</TT>
<BR><TT>expect you to keep your time frame, so unless you are really sure
of your</TT>
<BR><TT>capabilities I suggest you simply try and&nbsp; work on the second
version after</TT>
<BR><TT>the currently released version. i.e. if the current release is
1.x you start work</TT>
<BR><TT>on 3.x. Once you have completed it you can simply mail me the sources</TT>
<BR><TT>and assuming that I will have finished ver 2.x by that time, i
can simply</TT>
<BR><TT>progress at a faster pace. If I have finished 3.x by that time,
theres no real</TT>
<BR><TT>harm done as you will have got some programming practice. If youre</TT>
<BR><TT>implementation is better than mine, i'll simply switch the two.</TT>

and no suffix</TT>
