NOTES :-
30/6/98
Ok..this is your very confused programmer here. After recompiling
and making a slight change (which didnt do anything when i tried it
earlier) bugs seemed to mysteriously remove themselves for some reason.
I dunno why, but hey, is it works who gives a shit. (For all those
who wonder, yeah, i undid the small change and the bugs never came back..
not wanting to jinx(?) things i kept it in anyway. wtf.) im too tired to
think about anything right now so i'll keep the mystery to be resolved
until later. only one bug is left as of writing this and its evening
so i'll go back to netquake and hack on it later.

1/7/98
I've removed the annoying wait which i got too many complaints about anyway.
Also seem to have solved most bugs. 

2/7/98
I've fixed the invalid field write by patching it to enable and disable the
field while it is working. I've also added the annoying wait back(?) but not
by default. Now you have to select the info button on the menu to get the
wait back...this being mainly for my personal debugging pleasure..ok..ok..
i *liked* the wait.

8/7/98
Some (few) bugs added. All are non fatal and can be cured by resetting (warm)
..no biggie..i'll get rid of em soon.

22/12/98
(few) bugs turned out to be quite serious. Repatched the ZDOC field handler.
Now crashes without loading. im rewriting the field handler to support the
new string/charptr format.

26/12/98
Rewritten ZDOC handler. Seems to be stable & works ok. fixed new doc problem.
